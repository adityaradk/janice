# Model Training and Evaluation

Within this folder are all the files used to train and evaluate the models used for Janice.

For most models, we've included our save files (saved as `model.pkl` or `model.h5`). Files that were too big (>25 MB) are not included here.

For more information on the usage of these scripts, the `-h` argument can be used for all the models except those in the `ensemble` folder.
